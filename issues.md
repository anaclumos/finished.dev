## UI Components for Push Notifications
- Found reusable components in `src/components/ui/`:
    - `DropdownMenuCheckboxItem` (used for toggles in `component-example.tsx`)
    - `Card`, `Button`, `Switch` (though `Switch` was found via grep, its file wasn't in glob, likely part of another component or needs to be added if missing from `ui/`)
    - `AlertDialog` for permission requests.
- Patterns identified:
    - State handling: `React.useState` for local UI state in `ComponentExample`.
    - Convex integration: `ConvexClerkProvider` in `src/routes/__root.tsx`, mutations in `convex/pushSubscriptions.ts`.
- Recommendations:
    - Reuse the `DropdownMenuCheckboxItem` pattern for notification settings.
    - Use `src/lib/push.ts` helper functions alongside Convex mutations.
